    #
    #  * Messages may be delivered out of order
    #  * Messages may be dropped
    #  * It is harder to debug any issues since packets are not explicitly rejected.

    # On the other hand, sending data over UDP is master, since UDP is
    # connectionless, so there is less overhead for your application.
